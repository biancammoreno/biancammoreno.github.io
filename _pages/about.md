I am a third year PhD candidate at INRIA [Thoth](https://team.inria.fr/thoth/), and at [EDF R&D](https://www.edf.fr/en/the-edf-group/inventing-the-future-of-energy/r-d-global-expertise), advised by [Pierre Gaillard](http://pierre.gaillard.me/index.html), [Nadia Oudjane](https://fime-lab.org/oudjane-nadia/), and [Margaux Brégère](https://margauxbregere.github.io/). Prior to this I graduated with a masters and bachelor degree in Applied Mathematics from the engineering cycle (["Cycle Ingénieur”](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien)) of [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/), and a masters degree in machine learning from the program Mathematics, Vision and Leaning ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) from [École Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/).

My research focuses on the intersection of reinforcement learning and online learning algorithms, particularly within the context of convex reinforcement learning/mean field control. I am interested in understanding the theoretical aspects of sequential decision making in uncertain and non-stationary environments while also exploring their practical applications in energy management scenarios.
